Pitch Pro is an iOS application currently in development which will allow users to play any pitch or any interval in the standard western scale. It will also allow users to switch between different tuning systems in real time to hear how differently they sound.

Pitch Pro is being developed as a part of a Senior Project for the Music Technology program at Capital University, and is being developed mainly by Quinton Woodmansee.
